# 👩‍💻 Charuka Bandara | Engineering Enthusiast 🌟

Hi there! I'm Charuka, a passionate final-year **Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering** undergraduate with a knack for turning ideas into innovative solutions. My work lies at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **mathematics**, but I'm always exploring new horizons in tech.

### 🛠️ What I Do:
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Designing intelligent systems and exploring real-world applications like face recognition.
- **3D Design & Robotics**: Creating complex CAD models and mechanisms using tools like **SolidWorks**.
- **Programming & Software Development**: Writing efficient, scalable code in Python, C++, and more.

### 🌱 Currently Learning:
- Fine-tuning **deep learning models** (ResNet, FasterWhisper) for performance optimization.
- Improving robotic designs and real-time conversational AI pipelines.

### 🌟 Projects I'm Proud Of:
- **Face Recognition System**: Built a robust model using DeepFace with multithreading for faster processing.
- **Automatic Water Dispenser for pets**: Built an automatic water dispenser for my all time favourites:🐶 

### 💡 Fun Facts:
- When I’m not coding, I’m exploring **TikTok trends**, experimenting with content creation, or diving into self-care routines.
